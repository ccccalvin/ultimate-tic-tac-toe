# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe (unfinished)

An ultimate way to play Tic Tac Toe.

**objective:**
- 2 player game, alternating in turns
- there is a 3x3 grid of classic 3x3 tic tac toe boards
- a player wins when they create 3 board wins in a row (in other words, win the overall game of ultimate tic tac toe)

**gameplay:**
- player 1's turn: player 1 may play within whatever board in whatever square they want
- player 2's turn: player 2 must play within the board corresponding to the square in which player 1 has played their turn. for example...

example will be shown here, later...

- player 1's turn (again): player 1 must play within the board corresponding to the square in which player 1 has played their turn, etc.
- when someone has won on one of the smaller board, the player that won claims that board for their own.
- Any remaining empty squares on that board will be disabled (you will no longer be able to play on that board).

**rules/niches:**
- if a player is directed to play on a board which has already been claimed, they may play their turn wherever they want.
